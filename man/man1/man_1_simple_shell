NAME
       hsh - a simple shell implementation in C

SYNOPSIS
       hsh

DESCRIPTION
       The hsh command starts an interactive shell that reads commands from the
       standard input and executes them. The shell also supports non-interactive
       mode, where commands are read from a file or a pipeline.

       The shell implements a subset of the features provided by the standard
       POSIX shell, including:

       - Running commands with arguments and environment variables
       - Redirecting input and output using file descriptors
       - Pipelining commands using the | operator
       - Running background processes using the & operator
       - Running shell scripts using the . or source command

       The shell does not support features such as command substitution, shell
       variables, or shell functions.

OPTIONS
       The hsh command does not take any command line options.

EXIT STATUS
       The hsh command returns the following exit statuses:

       0 - Success
       1 - General error
       2 - Misuse of shell builtins
       126 - Command found but not executable
       127 - Command not found
       128 - Invalid argument to exit
       130 - Shell terminated by interrupt signal

EXAMPLES
       Here are some examples of using the hsh shell:

       $ ./hsh
       $ ls
       file1 file2 file3
       $ echo "Hello, world!"
       Hello, world!
       $ exit

       $ echo "ls" | ./hsh
       file1 file2 file3

       $ cat script.sh
       ls -l
       echo "Hello, world!"
       $ ./hsh script.sh
